## 📌 Overview

This is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based chatbot built using:

- **LangChain** for chaining components (retriever + LLM)
- **FAISS** for semantic vector search
- **Sentence Transformers** for high-quality embeddings
- **Streamlit** for a simple, clean web UI
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5** as the LLM backend

It reads your documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT), indexes them, and answers your questions using the most relevant chunks — with proper source citations.

## 🧠 What This Project Does

✔️ Ingests documents from the `data/` folder  
✔️ Splits them into semantic chunks  
✔️ Embeds them using `multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`  
✔️ Stores vectors in FAISS index  
✔️ Uses LangChain RAG pipeline to answer questions  
✔️ Displays source file citations  
✔️ Rebuilds the FAISS index automatically if missing  
✔️ Web interface powered by Streamlit  
✔️ Feedback buttons included (👍 / 👎)

## 📚 On What Document it is trained on  (Training Documents)

The chatbot is trained on a collection of documents stored in the `/data/` folder:

| 📄 Document Name         | Description                                             |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `Langchain.pdf`          | Covers the LangChain framework, its modules, and how it facilitates chaining LLM components for structured tasks. |
| `OpenAI.pdf`             | Provides introductory knowledge about OpenAI, its capabilities, models, and use cases. |
| `Python Tutorial.docx`   | A comprehensive tutorial on Python fundamentals, OOP concepts, and class-based structures. |
| `Transformer.pdf`        | Explains the Transformer architecture, its layers, attention mechanism, and relevance in LLMs. |
